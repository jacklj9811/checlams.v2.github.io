The Computational Laboratory for Advanced Manufacturing and Sustainability (CLAMS) is a newly established research group led by Dr. Zheyu Jiang, assistant professor in chemical engineering, at Oklahoma State University. At CLAMS, we develop systems engineering solutions to tackle some of the most pressing challenges of our time, including separations, pharmaceutical R&D and manufacturing, digital agriculture, sustainability, Food-Energy-Water Nexus, and more. The group is seeking one to two highly motivated and creative individuals to join the group as Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs) starting in Spring or Fall 2022. Undergraduate and master students with a strong background or interest in developing and applying PSE tools (such as mathematical modeling, optimization and control, AI and machine learning, etc.) to solve fundamental problems in advanced manufacturing and sustainability are encouraged to apply. During their PhD studies, the GRAs will be offered full tuition and stipend that covers their education and living expenses.
