  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

Complete removal of polystyrene from the nanosheet suspension in toluene is demonstrated by centrifugation of the suspension across chlorobenzene as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Rate-zonal centrifugation in a nonlinear density gradient fractionated exfoliated MFI-nanosheets from unexfoliated particles. The purified nanosheets were highly crystalline as indicated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and electron diffraction (ED). Coating of purified MFI-nanosheets on a smooth α-alumina support, fabricated by filtration of α-alumina suspension, led to a compact, b-oriented, 80-nm-thick film. A mild hydrothermal treatment of the film led to a 200-nm-thick membrane, which demonstrated molecular sieving properties.},

A systematic method of enumerating all HMP configurations is introduced. The energy savings of HMP configurations is compared with the well-known fully thermally coupled (FTC) configurations. HMP configurations can have very similar and sometimes even the same minimum total vapor duty requirement as the FTC configuration is demonstrated, while using far less number of column sections, intermediate transfer streams, and thermal couplings than the FTC configurations.},

abstract = {Nowadays, large amounts of data are continuously collected by sensors and monitored in chemical plants. Despite having access to large volumes of historical and online sensor data, industrial practitioners still face several challenges in effectively utilizing them to perform process monitoring and fault detection, because: 1) fault scenarios in chemical processes are naturally complex and cannot be exhaustively enumerated or predicted, 2) sensor measurements continuously produce massive arrays of high-dimensional big data streams that are often nonparametric and heterogeneous, and 3) the strict environmental, health, and safety requirements established in the facilities demand uncompromisingly high reliability and accuracy of any process monitoring and fault detection tool. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce a robust and reliable chemical process monitoring framework based on statistical process control (SPC) that can monitor nonparametric and heterogeneous high-dimensional data streams and detect process anomalies as early as possible while maintaining a pre-specified in-control average run length. Through an illustrative case study of the classical Tennessee Eastman Process, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel chemical process monitoring framework.},

Advanced agro-hydrological models today use the Richards equation, a highly nonlinear, degenerate elliptic-parabolic partial differential equation that captures irrigation, precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, and drainage. State-of-the-art Richards equation solvers employ either a finite difference, finite element, or finite volume discretization framework in space. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational framework to solve generic n-dimensional Richards equation by introducing global random walk and deep neural network to a modified finite volume method (FVM). Furthermore, for n-dimensional Richards equation, we introduce multipoint flux approximation to the FVM framework. Through these innovations, our novel computational framework effectively utilizes the underlying physics behind the Richards equation, which enhances the speed and accuracy of the solution process. Through an illustrative case study, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our computational framework and show that it correctly characterizes the physical relationships among soil moisture content, pressure head, and flux.},

In addition to structural complexity, agrochemical supply chains are also subject to seasonality and various unique uncertainties, thereby demanding high system resilience and implementation of risk management strategies in the face of these uncertainties and disruptions. In this study, we formulate and optimize the supply chain of an agrochemical active ingredient by formulating a stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. This MINLP formulation is scenario-based with demand uncertainty addressed by Value-at- Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). For the first time, we propose to reformulate these nonlinear CVaR constraints using perspective reformulation techniques. We show that these perspective cuts give a tight approximation of the original MINLP model.

Despite having access to large volumes of historical and online sensor data, industrial practitioners still face challenges in the era of Industry 4.0 in effectively utilizing them to perform online process monitoring and fast fault detection and diagnosis. To target these challenges, in this work, we present a novel framework named “FARM” for Fast, Accurate, and Robust online process Monitoring. FARM is a holistic monitoring framework that integrates (a) advanced multivariate statistical process control (SPC) for fast anomaly detection of nonparametric, heterogeneous data streams, and (b) modified support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and robust fault classification. Unlike existing general-purpose process monitoring frameworks, FARM’s unique hierarchical architecture decomposes process monitoring into two fault detection and diagnosis, each of which is conducted by targeted algorithms. Here, we test and validate the performance of our FARM monitoring framework on Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) benchmark dataset. We show that SPC achieves faster fault detection speed at a lower false alarm rate compared to state-of-the-art benchmark fault detection methods. In terms of fault classification diagnosis, we show that our modified SVM algorithm successfully classifies 17 out of 20 of the fault scenarios present in the TEP dataset. Compared with the results of standard SVM trained directly on the original dataset, our modified SVM improves the fault classification accuracy significantly.},

abstract = {In this work, we introduce MOLA, a multi-block orthogonal long short-term memory autoencoder paradigm, to conduct accurate, reliable fault detection of industrial processes. To achieve this, MOLA effectively extracts dynamic orthogonal features by introducing an orthogonality-based loss function to constrain the latent space output. This helps eliminate the redundancy in the features identified, thereby improving the overall monitoring performance. On top of this, a multi-block monitoring structure is proposed, which categorizes the process variables into multiple blocks by leveraging expert process knowledge about their associations with the overall process. Each block is associated with its specific orthogonal long short-term memory autoencoder model, whose extracted dynamic orthogonal features are monitored by distance-based Hotelling's T2 statistics and quantile-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) designed for multivariate data streams that are nonparametric and heterogeneous. Compared to having a single model accounting for all process variables, such a multi-block structure significantly improves overall process monitoring performance, especially for large-scale industrial processes. Finally, we propose an adaptive weight-based Bayesian fusion (W-BF) framework to aggregate all block-wise monitoring statistics into a global statistic that we monitor for faults. Fault detection speed and accuracy are improved by assigning and adjusting weights to blocks based on the sequential order in which alarms are raised. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our MOLA framework by applying it to the Tennessee Eastman process and comparing the performance with various benchmark methods.},

abstract = {The global agrochemical market is highly consolidated, with large multinational companies accounting for a major share of the market. Thus, even for a single agrochemical product, its global supply chain typically involves numerous paths connecting the raw material sources to the final customers. Besides structural complexity, agrochemical supply chains are also subject to seasonality and other unique uncertainties, thereby posing a need for risk management tools and strategies. In this study, we model and optimize an agrochemcial supply chain by developing and solving a stochastic mixed-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). We model and control the demand uncertainty in this scenario-based MIQCP using variance. We also apply perspective reformulation techniques to convert the MIQCP to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Computational experiment results from an illustrative example show that, successively introducing perspective cuts to the reformulated MILP not only leads to a tight approximation of the original MIQCP model, but is also more computationally efficient than directly solving the MIQCP.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is a key hydrological parameter that has significant importance to human society and the environment. Accurate modeling and monitoring of soil moisture in crop fields, especially in the root zone (top 100 cm of soil), is essential for improving agricultural production and crop yield with the help of precision irrigation and farming tools. Realizing the full sensor data potential depends greatly on advanced analytical and predictive domain-aware models. In this work, we propose a physics-constrained deep learning (P-DL) framework to integrate physics-based principles on water transport and water sensing signals for effective reconstruction of the soil moisture dynamics. We adopt three different optimizers, namely Adam, RMSprop, and GD, to minimize the loss function of P-DL during the training process. In the illustrative case study, we demonstrate the empirical convergence of Adam optimizers outperforms the other optimization methods in both mini-batch and full-batch training. },
